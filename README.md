# Landing Page Project

In this project I've tried to do all the work with JavaScript, I nearly didn't write any HTML or CSS code,
even all the styling that I've written was in JavaScript.

## Project Description

In this project, I've created a nav bar and styled it completely with JavaScript. I've also created 4 sections in the navbar each section correponds to a real section on the document. I've also added the funcitionality to scroll to the desired section  when you click on the corrresponding section in the navbar menu.

I've also created a button, this button gives you the ability to add a new section, and when you click on the button, a new section is created in the navbar, and also the corresponding section is created on the document.

Everything is illustrated with comments, and commited to a remote repository on GitHub, and you can track my progress if you need to make sure that there is no plagiarism.
